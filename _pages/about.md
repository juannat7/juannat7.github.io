I am a PhD student at Columbia University advised by Pierre Gentine. Before my PhD, I obtained my undergraduate degree at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My research interest lies in the intersection of chaotic systems and their predictability, generative/probabilistic modeling, and deep data assimilation. Aside from research, I greatly enjoy detective and science fiction works by Agatha Christie, Isaac Asimov, and Jules Verne among many others!
